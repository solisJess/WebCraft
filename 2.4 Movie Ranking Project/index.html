<h2>My top 3 shows of 2023</h2>
<hr />

<h3>From</h3>
<p>This has been my favorite show so far. It is definitely underrated<br>
and I can't believe that more people are talking about this show. <br/> 
The show is about a town of people that are stuck in a small town <br/>
where creatures lurk around at night and there is no way out. </p>

<h3>The Last of Us</h3>
<p>This show was good and was great to see Pedro Pascal in it. I do think <br />
that it is a little bit overrated but I think it's because of the cast that the <br>
show got as much attention as it did.  </p>

<h3>The White Lotus, Season 2</h3>
<p>The second season is a lot better to me than the first season was. I don't <br/>
know if it was because of the cast and the fact that I love Aubrey Plaza <br />
but I thought that the storyline of the second season had a lot of depth.  </p>
